                Amina used to walk miles every day to collect water for her family. Thanks to your support, her village now has a clean water well. Amina can go to school and her family is healthier and happier.

        <p> 703 million people lack basic access to clean and safe drinking water. Worldwide, women and girls are responsible for collecting water in 80% of households. When a community receives clean water women get hours back in their day and take charge of their own futures. Less time collecting water means more time in class. With access to clean water, kids around the world could get 443 million school days back every year. Every $1 invested in clean water can yield $4.30 in economic returns. Access to clean water is perhaps the single most powerful investment for sparking economic growth humanity has ever known. Access to clean water and basic sanitation can save around 16,000 lives every week.</p>
